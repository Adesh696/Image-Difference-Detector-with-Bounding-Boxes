# Image Difference Detection and Bounding Box Highlighting

## Overview
This project is aimed at developing a computer vision model that can automatically detect differences between two images and draw bounding boxes around the identified discrepancies. The model utilizes the Structural Similarity Index (SSI) and OpenCV to achieve this.

## Introduction
The goal of this project is to provide a simple yet effective tool for identifying differences between two images. It can be used for various applications, such as image comparison, anomaly detection, or quality control.

## Libraries and Dependencies
The following libraries are required to run the project:
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- scikit-image

Install the dependencies using the following command:
```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy scikit-image matplotlib
